Project Euler in Groovy
=======================

As the the titles suggests, these are the Project Euler mathematical / programming exercises done in the Groovy programming language. My personal aim was to use these as a way to explore and get practice in Groovy, a language which - at the beginning of the exercise - I had little experience in. As such, there are several places where my syntax is awkward or convuluted, simply through not knowing better. The actual value of any solution has been checked against Project Euler, but see my caveats below. The actual solution is usually wrapped in a function that neatly prints out the answer and execution time.

These exercises may be found on the web at `my personal website <http://www.agapow.net/programming/java/euler-in-groovy>`__ or from `my Github repository <http://github.com/agapow/euler-groovy>`__. The website may lag behind the code repository.

Some caveats:

* There may be the occassional solution that does not work, perhaps using an approach that is theoretically possible but practically not (e.g. runs out of memory or time) or was simply a bad idea. I've sometimes left these in as a record of a valuable learning experience. Read the comments in every solution for details.

* Some problems are solved in multiple ways, simply because it was interesting.

* A library of common utilities is used, to allow for consistent and brief solutions.

* While Project Euler assures that all solutions should compute in under a minute, I have found that some way overshoot this. This may be due to deficits in the programminmg languages or in my solution. All solutions are generated on a 3.2Ghz Xeon with 1gig of RAM.
